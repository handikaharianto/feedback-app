# Feedback App

This is a project from [React Front To Back 2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-front-to-back-2022/) course by Brad Traversy.

This project is used to brush up my knowledge about React concepts.

New things that I learn:

1. **useContext**: How to separate it from the main file.
2. **React Composition**: How to create shared React components to prevent duplicate codes.

Frontend:

- CSS
- JavaScript
- React

Backend:

- json-server (for now)

> Planning to add the backend in the near future...
